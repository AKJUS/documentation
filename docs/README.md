# IBM Cloud Terraform modules documentation

?> _DRAFT_: This content is not finalized

The IBM Cloud Terraform modules project is a collection of open source Terraform modules that help you build, update, and version complex and compliant environments that you can deploy in IBM Cloud. The goal of this project is to share and collaborate on useful infrastructure as code (IaC) and automation assets.

You can use [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) to specify your cloud infrastructure resources and services by using the high-level scripting HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL).

## Benefits of using IBM Solution as code

| Benefit | Description |
|---|---|
| Codify your IBM Cloud environment | Use a high-level scripting language to declare all the IBM Cloud resources and services that you want. Instead of learning the API or command-line to work with a specific resource, you use Terraform configuration files to specify the required state and resource configuration. Then, you use Terraform on IBM Cloud to rapidly build, configure, and replicate the resources in your cloud environments. |
| Automate cloud resource lifecycle | By using Terraform templates to build your cloud environment, you can orchestrate the provisioning, update, and deletion of your IBM Cloud resources, and easily replicate your configuration across environments. |
| Enable Infrastructure as Code | By codifying your cloud environment, you can treat your Terraform templates the same way as you treat your app code. You can author your templates in any code editor, check them into a version control system such as GitHub, and let your team review and monitor updates before you apply these changes in your cloud environment. By applying these DevOps core practices, you can enable Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for your cloud environments. |
