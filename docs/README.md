# IBM Cloud Terraform modules documentation

The IBM Cloud Terraform modules project is a collection of open source Terraform modules that help you build, update, and version complex and compliant environments that you can deploy in IBM Cloud. The goal of this project is to share and collaborate on useful infrastructure as code (IaC) and automation assets.

You can use [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) to specify your cloud infrastructure resources and services by using the high-level scripting HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL).

To get started creating modules. see [Authoring guidelines](implementation-guidelines.md) and [Contributing to the IBM Cloud Terraform modules project](/contribute-module.md).
