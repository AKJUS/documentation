# Report an issue or request a feature

Use GitHub issues in the module repo to report an issue or request a feature. Or use the [terraform-ibm-issue-tracker](https://github.com/terraform-ibm-modules/terraform-ibm-issue-tracker/issues/new?assignees=&labels=repo-request+%F0%9F%86%95%2Cmodule-onboarding&template=new_repo.yml&title=%5BNew+repo%5D%3A+New+Terraform+module+repo) repo to request a repo for a new module.

Follow these guidelines to help the project maintainers to understand your issue, reproduce the behavior, and find related reports.

- Before you create an issue, check for similar issues.

  ?> **Tip**: If you find a closed issue that seems similar to what you're experiencing, link to the closed issue in the body of your issue.

- When you create an issue, feature request, or other idea, use an issue template. The requested information in the template helps us resolve issues faster.

For more information, see [Reporting issues and making requests](https://github.com/terraform-ibm-modules/.github/blob/main/.github/SUPPORT.md) in the IBM Cloud Terraform modules project.
